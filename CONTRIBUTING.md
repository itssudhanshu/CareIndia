# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

Contributions are handled in the form of Pull Requests. You fork this repository, create a new branch, make relevant changes, and submit a Pull Request â€“ once that's done we'll be able to review your PRs and merge them to the master branch.

Always submit a PR against a "Claimed Issue" that's been assigned to you. If an issue doesn't exist, please raise one first.



Remember to:

- Capitalize the subject line
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line

## Deployment

I am not able to push this application on Google Playstore because of their new policy "Apps referencing COVID-19, or related terms, in any form will only be approved for distribution on Google Play if they are published, commissioned, or authorized by official government entities or public health organizations."  
For the above reason I'm sharing the Apk Link:

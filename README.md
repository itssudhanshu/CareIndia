â€¢ Daily Live Feeds- Daily Feeds about cases in different states.  
â€¢ Resources- Get the Helpline details for all the State and City.   
â€¢ Country Stats- Individual countries stats with Pie Chart Representation.  
â€¢ Statewise Stats & Graphical Representation- Get all details of cases state-wise with graphical representation for better understanding.  
â€¢ World and Countries Stats- Get updates of World and countries cases.

## Integrated API's

[COVID19-India API](https://api.covid19india.org/) (All India Data)  
[NOVELCovid/API](https://corona.lmao.ninja/docs/) (World and Countries Data)

## Deployment

I am not able to push this application on Google Playstore because of their new policy "Apps referencing COVID-19, or related terms, in any form will only be approved for distribution on Google Play if they are published, commissioned, or authorized by official government entities or public health organizations."  
For the above reason I'm sharing the Apk Link:  
<a href="https://github.com/itssudhanshu/CareIndia/blob/master/CareIndia_v1.0.0_Light.apk?raw=true">CareIndia_v1.0.0_Light.apk</a>  

<h3>Building</h3>

Android Release: `flutter build apk` 

Android (arm64-v8a)/(armeabi-v7a): `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`  

If you have a connected device or emulator you can run and deploy the app with `flutter run`
